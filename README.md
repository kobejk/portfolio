This is my personal home page created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This site also uses the new [AppRouter](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), which is the now recommended way to create [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects.

## Motivation

This was created as a hands on way to learn some important front-end web technologies while also developing a useable home page for myself. It will be updated with personal portfolio projects when relevant.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
